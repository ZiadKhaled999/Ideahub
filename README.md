## About The Project

Idea Hub is designed to solve the problem of disorganized and ephemeral application concepts. Standard note-taking applications lack the specialized structure required to properly evaluate and track an idea's journey from conception to archival. This project provides that structure through a dedicated interface and a purpose-built data model.

The application utilizes a card-based, masonry grid layout for high-level visualization and a modal-based interface for detailed data entry and modification.

### Core Functionality

* **Secure User Authentication:** JWT-based authentication ensures all user data is private and secure.
* **CRUD Operations for Ideas:** Full create, read, update, and delete capabilities for all user-generated ideas.
* **Lifecycle Status Tracking:** Each idea can be assigned a status (e.g., `Idea`, `Researching`, `In Progress`, `Launched`, `Archived`).
* **Categorization & Tagging:** Support for multiple tags per idea enables complex filtering and organization.
* **Dynamic Filtering and Search:** A real-time search engine filters ideas by keywords, status, and tags.
* **Visual Organization:** Customizable color-coding for idea cards allows for at-a-glance grouping.

### Built With

This project is built on a modern, scalable technology stack.

* Node.js (v18.x or later)
* npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/ZiadKhaled999/ideahub.git](https://github.com/ZiadKhaled999/ideahub.git)
    cd ideahub
    ```
2.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. You can obtain these from your Supabase project dashboard.
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```
4.  **Initialize the database**
    Log in to your Supabase account and run the SQL script located at `db/schema.sql` to create the necessary tables and policies.

## Usage

### Running the Development Server

Execute the following command to start the Next.js development server.

```sh
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
Building for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:
npm run build

This will generate a .next folder with the compiled application. To run the production build locally:
npm start
