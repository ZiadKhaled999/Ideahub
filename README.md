### **Transforming Ephemeral Concepts into Tangible Assets.**
Standard note-taking applications fail to capture the structured journey of a digital product. Idea Hub is architected to solve this critical gap, providing a dedicated, purpose-built platform that ensures your most valuable ideas are meticulously tracked, evaluated, and primed for development.

## ✨ Core Functionality

* 🔐 **Fortified User Authentication:** Employs JWT-based security protocols to guarantee data integrity and user privacy.
* 📝 **Comprehensive Idea Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, providing complete control over your ideation assets.
* 📊 **Strategic Lifecycle Tracking:** Monitor progress with granular status assignments (`Idea`, `Researching`, `In Progress`, `Launched`, `Archived`).
* 🏷️ **Advanced Categorization Engine:** Utilizes a multi-tag system for sophisticated filtering, sorting, and organizational capabilities.
* 🔍 **High-Performance Search:** A real-time, indexed search engine allows for instantaneous retrieval of ideas by keyword, status, or tag.
* 🎨 **Visual Prioritization Matrix:** Assign custom color codes to idea cards for intuitive, at-a-glance grouping and strategic assessment.

| Variable                      | Description                                           | Required |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | :------: |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`    | The unique API endpoint URL for your Supabase project. |  `true`  |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | The public anonymous key for your Supabase project.   |  `true`  |

---

## ▶️ Operational Commands

### **Development Mode**
Initiates the Next.js development server with Hot-Module Replacement (HMR).
```sh
npm run dev
```
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
Production Build
Compiles and optimizes the application for production deployment.
npm run build

This command generates a production-ready .next directory. To serve this build locally, execute:
npm start

📡 API Endpoints
All backend communication is handled via a secure, RESTful API.
Idea Resource
 * GET /api/ideas
   * Retrieves a collection of ideas for the authenticated user.
   * Query Parameters: status, tag, q (search query).
   * Returns: 200 OK - An array of idea objects.
 * POST /api/ideas
   * Creates a new idea record.
   * Request Body: A JSON object representing the new idea.
   * Returns: 201 Created - The newly created idea object.
 * PUT /api/ideas/{id}
   * Updates a specified, existing idea by its unique identifier.
   * Request Body: A JSON object containing the fields to be updated.
   * Returns: 200 OK - The updated idea object.
 * DELETE /api/ideas/{id}
   * Permanently deletes an idea by its unique identifier.
   * Returns: 204 No Content.
🗄️ Data Architecture
The core data entity is the ideas table, which is protected by Row Level Security (RLS) to enforce data isolation between users.
ideas Table Schema
| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| id | uuid | PRIMARY KEY, default: uuid_generate_v4() | Unique identifier for the idea (PK). |
| user_id | uuid | FOREIGN KEY to auth.users(id) | Owning user's identifier (FK). |
| title | text | NOT NULL | The concise title of the idea. |
| description | text |  | A comprehensive description of the idea. |
| status | text | default: 'Idea' | The current stage in the idea's lifecycle. |
| tags | text[] |  | An array of text-based classification tags. |
| color | varchar(7) | default: '#ffffff' | A hex color code for UI card visualization. |
| created_at | timestamptz | default: now() | Timestamp of the record's creation. |
| updated_at | timestamptz | default: now() | Timestamp of the last record modification. |
🗺️ Future Vision
Our development roadmap includes several high-impact features:
 * [ ] Rich Text Editor: Implement a WYSIWYG editor for the description field.
 * [ ] File Attachments: Allow for the upload of mockups, documents, and other assets.
 * [ ] Team Collaboration: Introduce multi-user workspaces for collaborative ideation.
 * [ ] Analytics Dashboard: Develop a dashboard for visualizing key idea metrics and trends.
